**Demo Security Operations Course for Students**

This 3-hour training is designed to prepare upper high school and higher education students with the hands-on experience and practical knowledge needed to actively contribute to a Security Operations Center (SOC) at their school or institution.

Over four 45-minute, self-paced lessons, you'll explore SOC functions, best practices, and tools like Microsoft Sentinel, Defender, and Security Copilot, gaining skills in incident response and threat detection. You'll also work through simulated security incidents, applying real-world practices to build your problem-solving and decision-making abilities. By the end, you'll have the foundation needed to take on a role in your institutionâ€™s SOC and pursue further training and certifications in the cybersecurity field.
